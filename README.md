## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS media queries
- [Less](https://lesscss.org/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I completed this challenge using flexbox, but I'm less familiar with CSS grid, which may have been another viable solution. I'd like to learn and practice using grid in future projects, as it seems very powerful.
